Implementation of Spark algorithms


<FONT size="3pt"> <br> <b> KMeans implementation in spark. </b>
<ul>
We use data from the UCI website on TV commercials. 
You will find it at : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/TV+News+Channel+Commercial+Detection+Dataset 
The performance of our algorithm is then compared to the one of Scikit-learn in termes of inertia, homogeneity score, silhouette score and the number of iterations until convergence. 
Two initialization methods are also implemented : 
<li type=none > Random initialization: first centers are chosen randomly from the dataset. </li>
<li type=none > Kmeans++ : the first center is chosen randomly and then centers are chosen according to their distance. </li>
